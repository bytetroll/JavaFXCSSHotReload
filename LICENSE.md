** The JavaFX CSS HotReload library is released under a modified version of the MIT license.  The only difference between the original MIT license and this license is usage of the library.
   Continue reading below for further instructions.
   

If you use the library in your JavaFX program to hot reload your CSS during development and are not going to release the library source code,
you DO NOT have to supply any license text anywhere (but a shout-out and a link back to the repo's somewhere would be greatly appreciated).


If you do use this library for anything else other than development of your JavaFX program (including releasing the source code, or deriving works from, i.e. creating a hot reload feature for a GUI editor based on this library),
the standard MIT license applies.  All source code files MUST RETAIN the MIT license header text.
